                <p>For immediate release — Sept. 19, 2024</p>
                <p>(DALLAS) — Community colleges have long been an essential part of the higher education landscape,
                  offering a unique blend of affordability, flexibility, and quality education. For students eager to
                  jumpstart their careers or those planning to transfer to a four-year university, community colleges
                  provide an unparalleled pathway to success.</p>

                <h2>Affordable Education for All</h2>
                <p>One of the most significant advantages of community colleges is their affordability. With tuition
                  costs significantly lower than those of four-year institutions, community colleges make higher
                  education accessible to a broader range of students. This financial advantage allows students to
                  pursue their academic and career goals without the burden of excessive student debt. Many community
                  colleges also offer financial aid, scholarships, and work-study programs to further support their
                  students.</p>


                <h2>Flexible Learning Options</h2>

                <p>Community colleges are known for their flexible learning options, catering to the diverse needs of
                  their student populations. Whether students are recent high school graduates, working adults, or
                  parents, community colleges offer a variety of class schedules, including evening, weekend, and
                  online courses. This flexibility enables students to balance their education with work and family
                  responsibilities, making it easier to achieve their academic and career objectives.</p>
                <h2>Career-Focused Programs</h2>

                <div class="col-3 news-thumbnail float-end">
                  <img
                    src="https://www.dallascollege.edu/news/PublishingImages/headshots-464x464/Justin-Lonon-464x464.jpg"

                </div>

                <p>For students looking to enter the workforce quickly, community colleges offer a wide range of
                  career-focused programs. These programs are designed to provide practical, hands-on training in
                  fields such as healthcare, information technology, business, and skilled trades. Many community
                  colleges have strong partnerships with local industries, ensuring that their programs are aligned
                  with current job market demands. This alignment helps students gain the skills and knowledge needed
                  to secure well-paying jobs upon graduation.</p>



                <h2>Seamless Transfer Pathways</h2>

                <p>Community colleges also serve as a stepping stone for students planning to transfer to four-year
                  universities. Many community colleges have established articulation agreements with universities,
                  guaranteeing that credits earned will transfer seamlessly. This pathway allows students to complete
                  their general education requirements at a lower cost before transferring to a university to complete
                  their bachelor’s degree. Additionally, community college students often benefit from smaller class
                  sizes and more personalized attention from instructors, which can enhance their academic preparation
                  for university-level coursework.</p>

                <h2>Supportive Learning Environment</h2>

                <p>Community colleges are renowned for their supportive learning environments. With smaller class
                  sizes, students receive more individualized attention from faculty, fostering a more engaging and
                  interactive educational experience. Community colleges also offer a range of support services,
                  including tutoring, academic advising, career counseling, and mental health resources. These
                  services are designed to help students succeed academically and personally, ensuring they have the
                  support they need to reach their goals.</p>

                <h2>Diverse and Inclusive Communities</h2>

                <p>Community colleges are celebrated for their diverse and inclusive communities. Students from
                  various backgrounds, ages, and life experiences come together to learn and grow. This diversity
                  enriches the educational experience, promoting cultural awareness and understanding. Community
                  colleges are committed to creating an inclusive environment where all students feel welcome and
                  valued.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Community colleges are an excellent choice for students seeking to start their careers immediately
                  or transfer to a four-year university. With their affordability, flexible learning options,
                  career-focused programs, seamless transfer pathways, supportive learning environments, and diverse
                  communities, community colleges provide a solid foundation for academic and professional success.

                        <p>Thanks to the support of voters in our 2019 Bond Initiative, we are opening a number of new
                          buildings across the college.</p>
                        <p>I'm here at our Eastfield Campus, which is now home to a new Student Success and Academic
                          Building. This facility which stands at approximately 116,000 square feet now serves as a
                          “front
                          door” to our Eastfield campus. It's a “One-Stop Shop” facility with qualified team members and
                          resources designed to support the enrollment journey from registration to graduation. This
                          investment would not be possible without the continuous support of Dallas County voters.</p>
                        <p>And beyond Eastfield, several other of our campuses are opening new facilities this year as
                          well. These are more than just new buildings, but rather beacons of opportunity for our
                          students
                          and community. Just one more way we’re “transforming lives and communities” at Dallas College.
                        </p>
                        <p>My thanks to our Board of Trustees for their vision to support all of these facilities. And
                          to
                          our voters - again, thank you for your continued support. These activities represent our
                          commitment to you. And I hope you have the opportunity to visit these new buildings soon.</p>
                        <p>Have a great day.</p>

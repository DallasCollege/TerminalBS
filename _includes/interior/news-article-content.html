                <div class="caption"><strong>Dallas College Chancellor Justin Lonon</strong></div></div></div>“To receive this prestigious honor with my friend and fellow community college champion, Chancellor Elva LeBlanc, is fitting,” Chancellor Lonon said. “It represents the commitment of our colleges to create viable opportunities that enable our students, our workforce and our economy to thrive. When we work together, our communities win big.”</p><p>Dallas College and TCC last month signed a historic agreement to help fill the region’s high-demand jobs and boost economic vitality. Among other initiatives, the colleges will consider economic development centers for emerging technologies and a consortium to fill health care vacancies.</p><p>Dr. LeBlanc: “What an honor to share this award with my colleague Dr. Justin Lonon. Together we are working with business, community and education partners to create a powerful support system with far more capacity than would be possible for any single organization.”</p><p>In 2025, both schools will celebrate 60 years of transforming lives and communities.</p><p>“There is no question that when community colleges work together, our students and workforce win big,” Dr. Lonon said. “By strengthening our partnership with TCC, we are creating new opportunities for our students to gain the relevant skills and credentials to succeed now and in the future.”</p>

                            <p>Thanks to the support of voters in our 2019 Bond Initiative, we are opening a number of new buildings across the college.</p>
                            <p>I'm here at our Eastfield Campus, which is now home to a new Student Success and Academic Building. This facility which stands at approximately 116,000 square feet now serves as a “front door” to our Eastfield campus. It's a “One-Stop Shop” facility with qualified team members and resources designed to support the enrollment journey from registration to graduation. This investment would not be possible without the continuous support of Dallas County voters.</p>
                            <p>And beyond Eastfield, several other of our campuses are opening new facilities this year as well. These are more than just new buildings, but rather beacons of opportunity for our students and community. Just one more way we’re “transforming lives and communities” at Dallas College.</p>
                            <p>My thanks to our Board of Trustees for their vision to support all of these facilities. And to our voters - again, thank you for your continued support. These activities represent our commitment to you. And I hope you have the opportunity to visit these new buildings soon.</p>
                            <p>Have a great day.</p>
